<h1>jQuery Facets</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Every time I've needed faceted search capabilities, I've had to rewrite the JavaScript to do it. This plugin hopes to do away with that. I tried looking for an existing plugin that did what jQuery Facets does, but surprisingly I couldn't find any that offered the functionality that I wanted. Hopefully others will find this plugin useful too.</p>
